.Dt HARDENING 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hardening
.Nd HardenedBSD Hardening
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/pax.h
.Pp
In the kernel configuration file:
.Cd "options PAX"
.Cd "options PAX_HARDENING"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Various system hardening features have been implemented in
HardenedBSD.
Many of them deal with restricting what non-root users are able to do.
When the kernel is compiled with
.Cd option PAX_HARDENING ,
certain
.Xr sysctl 8
options are modified from their defaults.
See Appendix A for a list of all the
.Xr sysctl 8
option modifications.
.Pp
.Xr procfs 5
and
.Xr linprocfs 5
are modified to prevent arbitrary writes to a process's registers.
This behavior is controlled by the
.Fa hardening.procfs_harden
sysctl option.
.Pp
.Xr kld 4
related system calls are restricted to non-jailed, root-only.
Attempting to list using
.Xr modfind 2 ,
.Xr kldfind 2 ,
and the other KLD-related system calls will result in permission
denied if used by a non-root or jailed user.
